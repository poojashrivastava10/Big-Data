with a number of features. This is a model to predict the housing
prices, using multiple regression model. Evaluated the fit and determine if this is an appropriate model. 
1. Predict the house sale prices given the data set.
2. Learned what features are the most important in the sale price of the house (i.e., If I wanted to invest in a home, what features are most important to maximizing its resale value?).
